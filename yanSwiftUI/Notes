In stacks we have spacing property - it's the space between our elements in stack. Also alignment - alignment (in the stack) of the elements, the side (leading, trailing or center).
Divider is just the line that divides our views.
Padding - for example for the text - we make the frame space in the text - its bigger. By default it will be for all the sides. If we need just the special size - padding(.bottom, 50), for instance.
Spacer - divides our view for equal parts. Spacer gets all the space.

Working with text
lineLimit - the number of lines that we need
.truncationMode(.middle) - make the ... for the text in the center
.lineLimit(nil) - no limit for the lines of the text
.kerning(5) - space between symbols with space at the end (should be in the beginning)
.tracking(5) - space between symbols without space at the end (should be in the beginning)
